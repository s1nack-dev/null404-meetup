## Operational Security and Privacy While AWay

### Device Safety

- When connecting to wifi or ethernet at a hotel or coffee shop, never connect your devices directly to the network. Bad actors can not only intercept your traffic, they can exploit vulnerabilities in service that you have open ports for on your system
  - Always use a "travel" router. Ideally anything that can be powered by 5v USB. Optimially it would be running some variant of OpenWRT
  - Optionally, use a separate hotspot device, or hotspot off your phone if you're sticking to cellular connection

#### Laptop Considerations
Encrypt your data! Ensure system and firmware is up to date.

Easiest - Don't let laptop out of site
Laziest - Put laptop in safe

Safest if you have to leave laptop
- take glitter nailpolish and cover the screws on your laptop. Take a photo of the pattern of glitter
- Extreme - Bring small 2.5" or nvme external drive and copy OS to it. Ensure it's small enough to keep on you at all time. Take out internal drive and leave at home. When booting up system, plug drive in and boot off that.

- Optinally get a privacy screen
- Disable wifi/bluetooth


#### Cellphone
1. First option - GrapheneOS
2. Realistic Option - iOS and Android
   - Ensure phone is fully patched
   - Disable wifi. Not a bad idea to disable bluetooth if possible
   - make sure phone is backed up prior to traveling
   - disable face or finter unlock, especially at airports
   - optionally, there are privacy phone screens

## Hotel Room

Refuse room cleaning, unless you're present
Boobie trap hotel to know if someone's been there. You can attempt to play with the android app Haven
DOnt trust safes
Hide equipment somewhere that's not obvious, like behind entertainment center
Optionally you can check for cameras with a room sweeper

## Your home while away
- leave a few lights on
  - Can automate lights turning on or off
- Install cameras/alarm
- Leave a TV on, or even a stereo
