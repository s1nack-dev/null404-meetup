CyberSec Tuesday: Privacy Editions

Description:
This will be a new monthly session where we can get together and discuss our thoughts on digital privacy and personal security. @warelock will be doing an in-depth discussion titled "Financial Privacy is Liberty".  This talk will cover how to make advanced use of cryptocurrency in a safe and smart manner. He will go over how to purchase Bitcoin, Pirate Chain privacy coin, burner phones, VPNs, and a whole host of other privacy/anonymity-preserving goods and services. The goal is to teach everyone basic cyber self-defense, in a practical, proven, step by step manner, in order to help you preserve your privacy/anonymity, and consequently your individual rights, in this hostile digital age. There will also be an open round table discussion about the topic at hand.
