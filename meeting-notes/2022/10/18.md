----------

Install the software and verify that the Tor service is running:

sudo apt update && apt install tor torsocks

sudo systemctl status tor

sudo lsof -i -P | grep LISTEN | grep debian-tor

----------

Configure Tor to forward connections to your service:

sudo ls -la /var/lib/tor

sudo vi /etc/tor/torrc

HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_demo/
HiddenServicePort 8080 127.0.0.1:8080

sudo mkdir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_demo/
sudo chmod 700 /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_demo
sudo chown debian-tor:debian-tor /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_demo
sudo ls -la /var/lib/tor/ | grep hidden_service_demo

sudo ls -la /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_demo/

----------

Restart the Tor service get your Tor hidden service ".onion" FQDN:

sudo systemctl restart tor

sudo ls -la /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_demo/

Example:

sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_demo/hostname

283ho8whr93h9eh9h9hwf9h8hozsunfouhw49hauhiau34v9pwhf9htx.onion

NOTE: Make a note of your new hidden service ".onion" FQDN. This is just the domain name, not the full URL you'll need to connect to your hidden service, via Tor.

----------

Set up a temporary service to be hidden bu Tor:

In one terminal window:

sudo lsof -i -P | grep LISTEN | grep 8080

until [ ]; do date | nc -l -v -q 1 localhost 8080; done

----------

Do some connection testing to verify the service is running and accessible:

Test the service by connecting to it locally, via command line:

In another terminal window:

sudo lsof -i -P | grep LISTEN | grep 8080

nc -v localhost 8080

Test the service via command line:

curl -s http://localhost:8080

Use a standard web browser on the same PC to test the service, by going to:

http://localhost:8080

----------

Do some final connection testing, but this time, over Tor:

Download and install Tor Browser:

https://www.torproject.org/

Test the service over Tor, via Tor Browser:

Open Tor Browser
Get a connection (reconnect if you can't get through)
Check for updates
Never resize the window
Turn all Javascript off under "about:config"
Set the "Security Level" to "Safest"
Restart Tor Browser
Connect to "https://blahblahblah.onion:8080"

Finally, test the service over Tor, via command line:

torsocks curl -s http://localhost:8080
