Creating a non-root account as a replacement for the root account

Search for "IAM" > IAM > IAM Dashboard

Add MFA (for root user) > Name: Onlykey > Fido

Refresh the IAM dashboard screen to see the MFA entry

IAM dashboard > Policies > Create Policy > Visual editor > Choose a service > Search for EC2 > Select EC2 > Check off "All EC2 actions" > Resources > All resources > Close

Add additional permissions: S3, Lambda, KMS, IAM > Next review > Name: user1-user-rights

IAM Dashboard > Users > Add users > user name: user1

Check off access key and password > Custom password > XXXXXXXXXX> Next: Permissions

Attach existing policies directly > Search: user1-user-rights

AmazonEC2FullAccess
AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess 
user1-user-rights

NOTE: Also need to give access to IAM

Create user (will display API keys)

Copy the access key id and secret access key off somewhere for future reference

Access key id: XXXXXXX
key: YYYYYYYYY

Click on drop down in upper left and copy down your root account id

Account id: 12345678901234567890

Sign out of root
Sign in as new user > IAM User (not root) > Account id: put your account id here > IAM user name: user1 > Password: 

Change password: put old password and give a new password

new pw: XXXXXXXXXX

NOTE: We forgot to add MFA to the non-root user - Go back and add it

Go to VPC > Upper right, Change your region from the default to which one is geographically closer to you - ie. Oregon us-west-2

NOTE: Setups and pricing models can be different, per-region - Good idea: Pick a region and stick with it over the long run

NOTE: IAM and S3 are in the "global" region = Regionless

NOTE: Cloudformation is "Infrastructure as Code" - You can keep your configs in git

VPC dashboard > Your VPCs

NOTE: VPC = Virtual Private Cloud

If you have a VPC, go into that > Subnets

NOTE: You will have one subnet per availability zone (AZ)

EC2 dashboard > Instances > Launch Instances > Name: give it a name here > Application and OS Images > Select an OS > Select the exact AMI > Choose instance type (ie. hardware): t2.micro (or t1.micro) > Key pair (login) = SSH key > Create new key pair > Key pair name: warelock-key > ED25519 > Create key pair (save the private key from pop up) > Network settings > Allow SSH from > Click "My IP" on dropdown > Launch instance

NOTE: Application and OS Images = Golden images of pre-installed machines

NOTE: You can connect to your new EC2 instance via SSH to the external IP they gave it - Use "ec2-user" as your SSH username - You also need to specify "-i your downloaded .pem private key file"

NOTE: Don't forget to do a "Terminate instance" on the EC2 instance to shut it down, so you don't get charged anything for it further and save on your total allowed hours per year of running EC2 instances

NOTE: You can also use CloudTrail free service to track usage and give you alerts

CloudTrail > Event history

NOTE: You will see all account actions listed here as history events

NOTE: New KMS feature: External key stores (XKS) = You get to own your private keys, consulted live by AWS from your on-prem HSM machine, as needed
